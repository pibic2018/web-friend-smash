Friend Smash stores all inventory data (for coins and bombs) on the browser.
If you played on one device and then moved to another, your bombs and coins
would not be available there. If you had to reinstall the game because you
moved to a new computer, you wouldn't be able to pull in the bombs and coins
from your existing game.

Games released on multiple devices and platforms usually share some data to
provide a consistent experience between the different places people play.
It may be the player's inventory or progress in a game. The solution to
sharing this data is to store the data in the cloud where any device can
access it.

Parse is one of the many web services providing data persistence and cloud
storage. In this javascript, we are using Parse to take care of storing user
accounts and data for each player in the cloud. We will provide a brief overview
of these features and recommend reading more about other Parse products. Keep in
mind that Parse has help in case you run into any issues.

You may register at Parse.com to get an application ID and Javascript key:

var parseAppID = 'mynewAPPID';
var parseJSKey = 'myNewMasterKey';

/*
Parse has a specialized user class called Parse.User that automatically handles
much of the functionality required for user account management.

The Parse.FacebookUtils class has a logIn method which takes the Facebook user
ID along with information about the Facebook session.
